I am a PhD student & Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow 
at the University of Colorado Boulder. A **biostatistician**,
**quantitiative ecologist**, and **evolutionary biologist**, 
my work focuses on phenology—the temporal 
dynamics of key organismal life cycle events (i.e. growth, reproduction, 
maturation)—in response to variable environmental information. Specifically,
I am interested in how the "information content" of common phenological cues 
has changed and how this non-stationarity in cue systems is impacting organisms'
ecology and evolution.
My research is particularly motivated by phenological changes in high-mountain 
and agricultural ecosystems due to their importance for ecological reslience and
human food & water security.

My dissertation bridges **field experiments**, **theoretical approaches**, and 
advanced **computational statistics** to address these questions in plant 
communities.

Outside of research, I enjoy rock climbing, running, cycling, fly-fishing, 
reading, snowboarding, film photography, and most of all, spending time with my 
wife.
