      excerpt: 
        I am a **computational ecologist** specializing in phenological plasticity and landscape productivity. My work combines Bayesian statistical modeling, machine learning, and econometric methods to synthesize in-situ, remotely sensed, and simulated data. In this work, I am investigating the role that phenological plasticity plays in driving heterogenous rates of ecosystem response to changing conditions and the effect these responses have on resources critical to human society.

        I am a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder and a **Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow** (2025). My technical expertise includes statistical computing in **R, Python, Stan, and Julia**, as well as **geospatial analysis and high-dimensional data modeling**.
