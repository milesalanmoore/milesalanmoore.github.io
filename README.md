      excerpt: 
        I am a **quantitative ecologist** interested in the intersection between landscape scale vegetation dynamics, phenology, plasticity, and evolution. In my work, I seek to use Bayesian statistical models to join long term climate data, both *in-situ* and modeled, remotely sensed data, and field methods.
        <br /><br />
        I am currently a first year PhD student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado Boulder and where I work in the alpine tundra at the [Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research Site](https://nwt.lternet.edu/). I am a skilled programmer in R, Python, and Stan, and enjoy studying ecological theory!
        <br /><br />
        Previously, I worked as a **Professional Scientist** for the [Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research](https://www.colorado.edu/instaar/) where I engineered data pipelines to algorithmicly clean and publish long term climate time series, including eddy-covariance flux tower data. Before that, I interned for the [National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment](https://above.nasa.gov/) (NASA ABoVE) as a **Remote Sensing Data Analyst**.
