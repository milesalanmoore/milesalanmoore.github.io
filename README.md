      excerpt: 
        I am a **computational ecologist** specializing in landscape-scale vegetation dynamics, phenology, and evolutionary-ecology. My work combines Bayesian statistical modeling, machine learning, and causal inference to analyze long-term climate data, remote sensing observations, and field measurements. In particular, I am investigating the role that phenological plasticity plays in driving heterogenous rates of response to global change and their effects on tundra ecosystems.


        I am a PhD student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado Boulder, working in the alpine tundra at the [Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research Site](https://nwt.lternet.edu/). I develop hierarchical Bayesian models and scalable data pipelines to investigate ecological and climatic drivers of plant phenology across individual and landscape scales. My expertise includes statistical computing in **R, Python, Stan, and Julia**, as well as **geospatial analysis and high-dimensional data modeling**.


        Previously, I was a **Professional Scientist** at the [Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research](https://www.colorado.edu/instaar/), where I built automated data pipelines to clean and publish long-term climate datasets. Before that, I worked as a **Remote Sensing Data Analyst** for [NASAâ€™s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment](https://above.nasa.gov/) (ABoVE) where I worked on an interdiscplinary project to collate data from a joint field and airborne synthetic aperature radar campaign.
