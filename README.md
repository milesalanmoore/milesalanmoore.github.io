      excerpt: 
        I am a **computational scientist** and PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder, developing advanced statistical and simulation-based methods to improve our understanding of biological systems under uncertainty. My work focuses on plant phenology—the temporal dynamics of key plant life cycle events—in response to variable and often unreliable environmental information. By integrating **Bayesian generative modeling**, **machine learning**, and **high-performance computing**, I aim to build theoretically-grounded, data-driven models that inform resource management and decision-making in dynamic systems, including agricultural and mountain landscapes. I work across **R, Python, Stan, and Julia**, with expertise in applied computational statistics, geospatial analysis, and high-dimensional modeling.


        I am passionate about building generalizable computational tools that bridge scientific discovery and real-world application.


        Outside of research, I enjoy rock climbing, running, cycling, fly-fishing, reading, and most of all, spending time with my wife, Morgan.
