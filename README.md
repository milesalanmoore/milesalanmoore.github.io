      excerpt: 
        I am a **computational ecologist** specializing in plant phenological plasticity at the University of Colorado Boulder. My work combines generative Bayesian statistical models with machine learning. In this work, I am investigating the role that phenological plasticity plays in driving heterogenous rates of organismal response to changing conditions and the effect these responses have on mountain and agricultural systems. My technical expertise includes statistical computing in **R, Python, Stan, and Julia**, as well as **geospatial analysis and high-dimensional data modeling**.
