    "text": "Abstract\n\nPhenological shifts are near ubiquitous responses to climate change in both wild and agricultural systems, but the fitness consequences of these shifts are unclear. We evaluate how flowering phenology influences fitness and how climate influences the relationship between flowering phenology and fitness.\nWe use a large dataset of performance trials of oilseed sunflower varieties (Helianthus annuus L.) conducted since 1978 across the Great Plains of North America. We estimate the flowering time that optimizes yield (fitness) in 341 environments to quantify how climate variation impacts the optimal flowering time.\nWe find that temperature is a key driver of optimal phenology, with earlier and faster flowering favored in hotter years and locations. Flowering time differences explain 9% of the variation in fitness between sunflower genotypes within trials. Flowering shifts a week away from the optimum incurred substantial penalties, with a median yield reduction of 23%.\nOur results indicate that the shifts to earlier phenology commonly observed under climate warming may be beneficial. In sunflower, maximizing agricultural productivity under future climates will likely require both careful selection of varieties to match new conditions as well as breeding new varieties that flower faster than material that is currently available commercially."

Using 512 0.25 \\(\\times\\) 0.25 m subplots in 80 plots across four carefully chosen sites, a third were transplanted to a paired site (from Cold to Warm or Warm to Cold), another third were transplanted within-site, and the final third are untreated control subplots.\nMy labmate labmate Katie and I are tracking the phenology, demography, and fitness of more than a 1000 individually marked plants of the species Bistorta bistortoides and Bistorta vivipara.These two closely related species have very different life histories and understanding their sensitivites to environmental change will help scientists build a predictive framework for vegetation change in high elevation ecosystems. Vegetation composition and phenology are important controls on water and energy cycles in alpine ecosystems which provide resources for humans and agriculture for billions of people worldwide.\nCheck out Isabella’s article at kunc.org here.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I believe in being transparent and explicit about the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, like Large Language Models (LLMs), in my intellectual work. On this page, you’ll find a collection of statements about if and how I use AI for specific tasks.\n\n\nEverything in my research and on this website was written by me.\n\n\nAI tools are becoming ubiquitous in the daily workflow of many knowledge workers. These text-generation models are showing up in email applications, coding environments, job application portals, internet search engines, and just about anywhere else they can be embedded. The implicit promise of these tools is that they save time and money by reducing the amount of human effort required in tasks ranging from mundane to mission-critical. Here’s how I am using (or not using) these tools:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe /ai manifesto\n\n\n\nI was inspired to write this page by Andrew Heiss’ own version of this sort of statement, as well as the references he linked: “The ‘/ai’ manifesto”. See the /ai public database for more.\n\n\n\nWriting\nI am strongly opposed to the use of AI for writing anything. I have been particularly persuaded by arguments in this area that, because LLMs are statistical prediction machines, the model is completely and utterly incapable of regard for the moral or ethical content of the text that it generates. It is also almost impossible to verify the intellectual provenance of any text generated. This means that they generate meaningless, immoral, nonsensical text with no real ideas stringing anything together. In short, there is not a human behind the writing, so how could it possibly be worth reading? For this reason, I do not use LLMs to generate any portion of a research paper, cover letter, email, blog post, course assignment, or similar text.\n\n\nCoding\nI am still figuring out how I feel about this one. I do sometimes use LLMs in my coding—most often to:\n\n\nDocument or comment on long scripts or functions.\n\nTurn a chunk of code I’ve written into a more general function with type checks and tests.\n\nTranslate from one language to another.\n\nExplain complex code chunks.\n\nReview code for logical errors or potential problems.\n\nPlotting data\n\n\nI’ve found LLMs are really crazy good at these things and bad at most others. An important note is that I am extremely against the use of LLMs/AI for coding (even in the use cases above) when it comes to anything near a statistical model or other research-related data analysis. See the Researching section below for more discussion on this.\n\n\nLearning\nI think this might be one of the worst use cases for LLMs, depending on what exactly is being “learned.” I value the struggle in learning something new. I think that is what actually develops problem-solving and critical thinking. Admittedly, though, I did use OpenAI’s ChatGPT to help me understand some Numerical Linear Algebra homework recently, and it was really helpful. As a general pattern, though, I try not to use it. Whenever I find myself using it I later come to regret not having just gone straight to a textbook, documentation, or other primary source where I realized I would’ve learned what I needed and then some…\n\n\nImages and Video\nI have less sophisticated thoughts here currently. I have used Generative AI to create images before. In fact, the little favicon for this website was generated using an LLM! When I see AI generated figures in manuscripts though, something about it irritates me a bit. Maybe I shouldn’t be so grumpy about it though… if the graphic communicates information effectively I guess it is fine."

    "text": "My research spans ecology, evolution, and ecophysiology. I study the role that time and uncertainity play in shaping plant responses to the environment. In particular, I focus on plant phenology, the timing of annually reoccuring life-history events like growth, maturation, reproduction, and dispersal. Although I have specific expertise in alpine, arctic tundra, and agricultural systems, I view plant phenology as a unifying concept in ecology and evolution which integrates processes across biological scales.\nPlant phenology is an inherently individual and physiological process that can directly impact fitness, demography, and population persistence. At higher levels of organization, variation in phenological plasticity among species generates novel temporal community assemblies under variable environmental conditions. Taken together, these processes may scale to impact land surface and ecosystem phenology with critical implications for water, energy, agriculture, and ecosystem health."
