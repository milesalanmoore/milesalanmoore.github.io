I am a **computational ecologist** interested in the intersection between landscape scale vegetation dynamics, phenology, plasticity, and evolution. In my work, I seek to join long term climate data, both *in-situ* and modeled, remotely sensed data, and field methods. To do this, I use bayesian statistical models in causal inference frameworks.

I am currently a first year PhD student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado Boulder and where I work in the alpine tundra at the [Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research Site](https://nwt.lternet.edu/). I am a skilled programmer in R, Python, and Stan, and enjoy studying ecological theory! Recently, I have been focused on the use of machine learning in causal inference frameworks and the development of hierarchical Bayesian models to investigate drivers of the latent phenological development of alpine plants.

Previously, I worked as a **Professional Scientist** for the [Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research](https://www.colorado.edu/instaar/) where I engineered data pipelines to algorithmicly clean and publish long term climate time series, including eddy-covariance flux tower data. Before that, I interned for the [National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment](https://above.nasa.gov/) (NASA ABoVE) as a **Remote Sensing Data Analyst**.
