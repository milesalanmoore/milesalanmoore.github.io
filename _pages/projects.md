## Current Projects

### Phenological Plasticity and Agricultural Sunflower Yield  
In collaboration with Drs. Sarah Elmendorf, Nolan Kane, Eliza Clark, Brent Hulke, Peter Innes, and others, I am developing theoretically grounded hierarchical models to investigate how phenological plasticity influences sunflower yield across environments. This project aims to identify key drivers of yield variation and support agricultural that is resistant to environmental change.

### Hierarchical Bayesian Models of Plant Phenology  
I am developing hierarchical **state-space** models to study alpine tundra plant phenology under experimental manipulation. This project, implemented in Julia (Turing.jl), uses **latent variable** modeling to better characterize phenological dynamics and their impact on ecosystems and resources in the Western US.  

### Alpine Tundra Productivity Analysis  
I am leading a regional analysis of alpine tundra productivity trends across the Rocky Mountains using multi-temporal Landsat imagery, experimental data, and landscape simulation outputs. This work quantifies spatial and temporal variability in NDVI and investigates potential biophysical drivers of observed trends.
