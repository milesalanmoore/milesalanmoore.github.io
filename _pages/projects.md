## Current Projects

### Phenological Plasticity and Agricultural Sunflower Yield  
In collaboration with Drs. Sarah Elmendorf, Nolan Kane, Eliza Clark, Brent Hulke, Peter Innes, and others, I am applying **machine learning** and **causal inference** methods to investigate how phenological plasticity influences sunflower yield across environments. This project aims to identify key drivers of yield variation and support more resilient agriculture.

### Hierarchical Bayesian Models of Plant Phenology  
I am developing hierarchical Bayesian **state-space** models to study alpine tundra plant phenology under experimental manipulation. This project, implemented in Julia (Turing.jl), uses **latent variable** modeling to better characterize phenological dynamics and their impact on water resources in the Western US.  

### Alpine Tundra Productivity Analysis  
I am leading a regional analysis of alpine tundra productivity trends across the Rocky Mountains using multi-temporal Landsat imagery, experimental data, and landscape simulation outputs. This work quantifies spatial and temporal variability in NDVI and investigates potential biophysical drivers of observed trends.
