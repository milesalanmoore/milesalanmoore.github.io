## Past Teaching Experience

**EBIO 4410 / 5410 - Biological Statistics** (Fall 2024) --
In this position, I served as the sole instructor for two statistics lab sections serving 20 undergraduates and 15 graduate students. The course, designed and taught by Professor Pieter Johnson, aims to provide students with a thorough understanding of linear models including generalized linear mixed effects models in a frequentist null hypothesis significance testing inference framework. Additional course goals include model comparison, selection, and interpretation, data visualization, and a brief introduction to bayesian inference and bayesian model diagnostics.
