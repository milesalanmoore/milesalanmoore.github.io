    "text": "I am a computational scientist and PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder, developing advanced statistical and simulation-based methods to improve our understanding of biological systems under uncertainty. My work focuses on plant phenology—the temporal dynamics of key plant life cycle events—in response to variable and often unreliable exogenous information. By integrating Bayesian generative modeling, machine learning, and high-performance computing, I aim to build theoretically-grounded, data-driven models that inform resource management and decision-making in dynamic systems, including agricultural and mountain landscapes. I work across R, Python, Stan, and Julia, with expertise in applied computational statistics, geospatial analysis, and remote sensing.\nI am passionate about building generalizable computational tools that bridge scientific discovery and real-world application.\nOutside of research, I enjoy rock climbing, running, cycling, fly-fishing, reading, and most of all, spending time with my wife.\n\nEducation\nPh.D. Ecology and Evolutionary Biology\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder | Boulder, CO\n08.2024 - 05.2029 (expected)\nB.A. Ecology and Evolutionary Biology\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder | Boulder, CO\nsumma cum laude, With distinction, GPA: 4.0\n01.2022 - 12.2023\nAssociate of Science\nFront Range Community College | Westminster, CO\n08.2019 – 12.2021\n\n\nExperience\n05.2025 – 08.2025\nGraduate Research Assistant, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, Boulder, CO\n12.2023 – 08.2024\nProfessional Scientist I, Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, Boulder, CO\n05.2023 – 12.2023\nRemote Sensing Intern, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Greenbelt, MD\n08.2021 – 12.2023\nData Management Assistant, Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, Boulder, CO\n05.2021 – 08.2021\nField Research Assistant, Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, Boulder, CO\n\n\nTeaching\n08.2024 – 12.2024\nTeaching Assistant, University of Colorado Boulder\nEBIO 4410 / 5410 Biological Statistics"
