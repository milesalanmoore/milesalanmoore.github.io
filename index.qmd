::: {#hero-heading}

I am a **computational scientist** and PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder developing advanced statistical and simulation-based methods to improve our understanding of biological systems under uncertainty. By integrating **Bayesian generative modeling**, **machine learning**, and **high-performance computing**, I aim to build theoretically-grounded, data-driven models that inform resource management and decision-making in dynamic systems, including agricultural and mountain landscapes.
