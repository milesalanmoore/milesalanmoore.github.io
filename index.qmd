::: {#hero-heading}

I am a PhD student and [DOE CSGF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) Fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder developing advanced statistical and simulation-based methods to improve our understanding of biological systems under uncertainty. By integrating **Bayesian generative modeling**, **machine learning**, and **high-performance computing**, I aim to build theoretically-grounded, data-driven models that advance our understanding of natural systems.
