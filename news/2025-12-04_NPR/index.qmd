Last week, I joined my advisor, Nancy Emery, along with my labmate Katie Bardsley,
and NPR journalist Isabella Escobedo on a trip up to our field experiment at the
Niwot Ridge LTER to talk about our work on alpine plant responses to a changing
environment. 

In 2024, we established a Turf Transplant Experiment (which is now one in a 
global network of coordinated Turf Transplant Experiments). Using 512 0.25 
$\times$ 0.25 m subplots in 80 plots across four carefully chosen sites, a third
 were transplanted to a paired site (from Cold to Warm or Warm to Cold), another 
 third were transplanted within-site, and the final third are untreated control 
 subplots. 

My labmate labmate Katie and I are tracking the phenology, demography, and 
fitness of more than a 1000 individually marked plants of the species
*Bistorta bistortoides* and *Bistorta vivipara*. These two closely related 
species have very different life histories and understanding their sensitivites
to environmental change will help scientists build a predictive framework for 
vegetation change in high elevation ecosystems (i.e. when and why do we expect a
species to shift it's vegetative or reproductive phenology in response to the
environment). Vegetation composition and phenology are important controls on 
water and energy cycles in alpine ecosystems which provide resources for humans 
and agriculture for billions of people worldwide.
